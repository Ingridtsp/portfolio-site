        Hi all, I’m Ingrid Nicole, 36, full-time employee, full-time student, and full-time mom to a fearless six-year-old named Jade so yeah, no chill pretty much sums it up.
        I’m currently majoring in Business Analytics and Information Systems at USF and work full-time as a Project Manager at Citi, which means I spend my days toggling between 
        spreadsheets and snack time. My career goals are centered on building a successful and fulfilling path in business analytics and banking, where I can combine my analytical 
        skills with strategic decision-making to help organizations grow. I aim to advance into leadership roles that offer both stability and opportunities for professional growth, 
        while also maintaining flexibility to balance work and personal life. In the long term, I want to use my expertise to contribute to innovative financial solutions, mentor 
        others entering the field, and create a lasting impact in both my workplace and community. In this site you’ll find raw reflections, practical mindset shifts, and little 
        reminders that even in the messiest seasons, you’re still making progress. 
        If you’re navigating growth in a no-chill world, welcome you’re in good company. Let’s grow loud, grow honest, and grow real!
